# Global day and night cycle configuration
# A vanilla Minecraft day lasts 24000 ticks. DayUtils lets you customise
# both halves independently.
day:
  length: 12000        # Duration of the daytime portion in ticks
  nightLength: 12000   # Duration of the nighttime portion in ticks
  speed: 1.0           # Multiplier applied to the configured lengths

  # Custom day types let you trigger bespoke events on a schedule.
  # Provide the interval (in ticks) between repeats.
  customTypes:
    # sunrise: 1000
    # bloodmoon: 24000
